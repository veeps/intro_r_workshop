# Intro to R Workshop

## Overview
This workshop is designed as a one-hour intro to R workshop. Today we'll cover some fundamentals to data analysis in R. After this workshop, you will be able to:

- Install R and R studio
- Install and load packages
- Read in your own data
- Fundamentals of data frame analysis
- Create basic graphs

## Workshop format
We will be walking through examples throughout the course in the "student.Rmd" file. If you get lost following along the live coding sessions, you can see the "final.Rmd" file in the project folders for the full code.
